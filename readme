You will need separate versions of each page for each language (e.g., index-en.html, index-es.html, index-it.html) and modify the content of each page to reflect the translation. You can use a tool like Google Translate for initial translations or manage translations manually.

This is a basic template, but you can expand upon it to add more features like blog categorization, tagging, etc.
